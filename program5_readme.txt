- Types can be redefined in the scope they are declared in. so
int x; A x; is valid. The most recent definition of a variable is the used
declaration.

- method printing uses haskell-like syntax (I'm sorry) so it's of the form
 "name: argType1 -> argType2 -> argTypex -> retType" or
 "name: () -> retType" for functions with no parameters
