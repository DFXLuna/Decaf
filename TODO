- Fix interface to global type table no typedecls
- Somehow coerece the tree into typechecking itself

- Implement print and dump methods
- Implement Memory management
    - TM traverses tree calling destructor of each table. Each table deletes it's own pointers(GTT FOR TYPEDECL)
    - Possibly unneeded for general tables
- Enable error checking in Bison


Victory lap:
- Implement error type in tablemanager for more verbose failure
