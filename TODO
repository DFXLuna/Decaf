-More verbose errors

- There's a strange error where an assignment to an element in an array 
fails if the statement is the first statement in a block. so
"IntArray[1] = 1;" 
only works if it's not the first statement in a block.

- fix nameexpr as first statement in block

- Maybe fix anonymous scopes
