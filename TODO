Test Methdecl insertion

- Implement Table methods
    - add resolution methods for forward declarations meth and decl

- Implement Type Inst/Decl MethDecl methods
- Get table to add int and possibly void type to GTT
- Somehow coerece the tree into typechecking itself

- Possibly remove TypeInst

- fix ret type in methdecl from string to typedecl <- with printing
- Implement method for forward declarations of methods
and resolution of those declarations in tablemanager
- Implement print and dump methods
- Implement Memory management
    - TM traverses tree calling destructor of each table. Each table deletes it's own pointers(GTT FOR TYPEDECL)
    - Possibly unneeded for general tables
- Enable error checking in Bison


Victory lap:
- Implement error type in tablemanager for more verbose failure
