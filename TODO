- Method and constructor overloading isn't currently supported yet.

- There isn't currently a way for the program to verify if a return type
matches the return expression or if there even is a return expression.

- Value initialization isn't handled yet.

- There's a strange error where an assignment to an element in an array 
fails if the statement is the first statement in a block. so
"IntArray[1] = 1;" 
only works if it's not the first statement in a block.

- Error messages are vague and generally unhelpful.

Victory lap:
- fix nameexpr
- Fix method overloading?
- Maybe fix anonymous scopes
